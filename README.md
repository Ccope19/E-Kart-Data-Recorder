# E-Kart-Data-Recorder
This project is unlicenced and open-source to the public domain.  If one feels so inclined, they may cite the original creator (me) as my account username "Ccope19". 

The project is powered by the 4 lead-acid batteries that power the rest of the go-kart or any other power source between 7 volts and 59 volts.  This is done with a buck converter IC (LM2576HV) and capacitors and an inductor to smooth out the voltage.  This is then routed to all of the sensors, driver boards, data logger, and microcontroller.  The microcontroller is an ATMega328-P which is the same as an Arduino Uno R3 and requires a 16MHz crystal, 2 20pF ceramic capacitors, and a 10k pull-up resistor for the reset pin in order to function.  The microcontroller is programed through the ICSP headers on the data logger shield.  Once programmed, the microcontroller gets data from two switches and the hall effect sensor as well as the RTC (real time clock).  This info is then used to be written to the SD card or sent to the display drivers to be displayed on the 7-segment displays.  The displays are red, yellow, and green to represent the time, motor RPM, and speed respectively.
